# Control-Plane

An approach to *orchestration* that is able to cater the needs of higher order entities 
e.g. regions, data centers, servers to the lowest most entity i.e. an application. In 
short an approach that takes care of the entire ecosystem impacted by an application. An
ecosystem can encompass a lot of additional entities in addition to above mentioned higher
order entities, e.g. people, processes, companies, operations, customers, compliances, etc. 
It can be thought of as something that has profound impact on the people handling development, 
operations, releases to begin with but is definitely not limited to these. This very impact 
travels faster & affects lives within this so called *ecosystem*.

# Why ? What is the need ?

There are numerous types of applications. *Perhaps they can be termed as a primitive form of robotic 
species*. There are multitude of ways these applications are handled. They have a tag, have an SLA,
and form the building blocks of various line of businesses. They are the nerves of action of any modern 
day enterprise. 

So how do you manage these applications with the advent of cloud (*or let's say virtualization*) ? 
These operations are now delegated to managed service providers (*i.e. the so called cloud providers*). 
These application now span across clusters, nodes, racks, datacenters, or even regions (*geographies*). 
The question that comes up is: *how do we build, deploy, & manage **millions** of application instances* ?

Effective tooling that caters to discovery (*i.e. a generic requirement*) & configuration (*i.e. a 
business/service specific requirement*) are the steps in the right direction. These can be termed as 
mere *baby steps* to the world of managing applications in cloud. Much more needs to be thought of & 
done by augmenting features that are a necessity when dynamics of applications have changed.

you to choose the one that caters to your needs.
