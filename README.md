# Control-Plane

An approach to **orchestration** that understands & caters to any application (*in the world of 
Information Technology*) & its ecosystem. Here ecosystem encompasses a lot of things e.g. people, 
processes, companies, operations, customers, compliances, etc. It can be thought of as something 
that has profound impact on the people handling development, operations, releases to begin with 
but is definitely not limited to these. This very impact travels faster & affects lives within 
this so called *ecosystem*.

# Why ? What is the need ?

There are numerous types of applications. *Perhaps they can be termed as a primitive form of robotic 
species*. There are multitude of way these applications are handled. They have a tag, have an SLA,
and form the building blocks of various line of businesses. They are the nerves of action of any modern 
day enterprise. 

So how do you manage these applications with the advent of **cloud (or even virtualization)** ? 
These operations are now delegated to managed service providers (*i.e. the so called cloud providers*). 
In addition, there is a burst of micro-service patterned / oriented applications. None of these 
applications want to be tagged as being `monolith`. These application now span across clusters, 
nodes, racks, datacenters, or even regions (*geographies*). 

Effective tooling that caters to discovery (*i.e. a generic requirement*) & configuration (*i.e. a 
business/service specific requirement*) are the steps in the right direction. These can be termed as 
mere *baby steps* to the world of managing applications in cloud. Much more needs to be thought of & 
done by augmenting features that are a necessity when dynamics of applications have changed.

you to choose the one that caters to your needs.
