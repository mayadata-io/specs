# Why ? What is the need ?

Architectures are becoming distributed. It may span across clusters, nodes, racks, datacenters, or even 
geographies. Effective tooling that caters to discovery (*i.e. a generic requirement*) & configuration 
(*i.e. a business/service specific requirement*) are the steps in the right direction. It can go on to 
augment with various other features that arise from making applications ditribution aware. Refer the 
[link](https://github.com/openebs/Control-Plane/blob/master/How%20to%20choose%20one.md) that helps you to
choose one catering to your needs.
