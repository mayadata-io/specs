# Control-Plane

An approach to **orchestration** that understands & caters to any application & its ecosystem.
Here ecosystem is very big that has impact in some way or other to people handling development,
operations, companies, customers, releases.

# Why ? What is the need ?

There are numerous types of applications. *Perhaps they can be termed as a primitive form of robotic 
species*. There are multitude of way these applications are handled. They have a tag, have an SLA,
and form the building blocks of various line of businesses. They are the nerves of action of any modern 
day enterprise. 

So how do you manage these applications with the advent of cloud. The roles get quickly delegated to
managed service providers (*the cloud providers*). In addition, there is a burst of micro-service
patterned applications. They are moving away from being tagged as `monolith`. These application now span
across clusters, nodes, racks, datacenters, or even regions (*geographies*). 

Effective tooling that caters to discovery (*i.e. a generic requirement*) & configuration (*i.e. a 
business/service specific requirement*) are the steps in the right direction. These can be termed as 
mere *baby steps* to the world of managing applications in cloud. Much more needs to be done and iterated
by augmenting various other features that are a necessity when dynamics of applications have change.

you to choose one catering to your needs.
