# specs

This repo will hold specs for projects under the openebs organisation.

This is an attempt towards implementation of below article:

## Do critical thinking up front

Writing forces you to think through specifics, in prose, 
before the expensive work of architecture, coding, design, qa, etc. takes place. 
It raises the quality of your decisions, and reduces the chance of surprises.

## Communicate efficiently

One way or another, you will communicate your proposal to various stakeholders 
(support, engineering, design, finance, management, etc.). 
A spec allows you to batch this communication, and to do it without ambiguity 
so your team can grok and respond intelligently.

## Raise accountability

By publicly committing to measurable goals you align the incentives of the team: 
stakeholders will realize how unreasonable last minute requests are, and 
engineers will think twice when making estimates.

# Template for specs

Your spec is a clearly communicated decision on what to build, and why. 
There are many ways to express your ideas in a structured manner, 
but at the heart of it, you must address these five things:

## The Problem

Frame the problem that you trying to solve. 
More importantly, explain why it is worth addressing. Be specific, and provide metrics.

## Measurable Goals

Promise clear deliverables and outcomes. 
Identify what’s out of scope. Make sure it’s easy to look at each goal and answer: did we hit it?

## Context

Provide evidence that your audience needs to understand the problem and believe in your proposal. 
Assumptions, use-cases, metrics, etc.

## Detailed Solution

Your proposal should be detailed enough for your team to consume and execute — think of it like 
code for human brains to run[1].

## Timeline

List dates and milestones that your team believes in. 
This section may start off vague, but should be finalized in your last spec review.


# Tech Specs

This can be supplemented by tech specs. This is about **how we did it** !!
The selected tech specs are blogged !!
